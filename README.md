The final task of the intensive training is to build a homepage for myself with CSS,HTML and  javascript, which includes four sections: "Home", "About me", "Portfolio", "Contact". This homepage should be able to describe my resume and my capibilities in details and be a very helpful introduction to others.

In addition, this homepage should also be well-adjusted for laptop and smartphones. The interaction between the homepage and users should be fun. So I add a small game in my homepage.
